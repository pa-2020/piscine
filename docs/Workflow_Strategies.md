# Workflow Strategies Best Practices :sparkles:

A good **workflow** positions all of the tools, processes and people for **optimum** *happiness* and *productivity*.

* Commit **all files** that belong to a task in a *single operation* to keep the project **consistent at all times**.
   * For example; fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits.
