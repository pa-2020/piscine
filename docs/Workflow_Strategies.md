# Workflow Strategies Best Practices :sparkles:

A good **workflow** positions all of the tools, processes and people for **optimum** *happiness* and *productivity*.

* Commit **all files** that belong to an *entire* task in a *single operation* to keep the project **consistent at all times**.

   * For example; fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits.

   * No other user should see partial or incomplete changes.

   * Small commits make it easier for other developers to understand the changes and roll them back if something went wrong.

   * An incomplete commit might build locally in your work area and pass all tests. But it could break in another team memberâ€™s work area.

   * Review code before committing to the mainline.

   * Make commits reversible
