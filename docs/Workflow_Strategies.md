# Workflow Strategies Best Practices :sparkles:

A good **workflow** positions all of the tools, processes and people for **optimum** *happiness* and *productivity*.

1. Commit Files With a Single Purpose — Not as a Backup

   a. For example; fixing a bug or adding a new feature. fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits.

   b. No other user should see partial or incomplete changes.

   c. Small commits make it easier for other developers to understand the changes and roll them back if something went wrong.

   d. An incomplete commit might build locally in your work area and pass all tests. But it could break in another team member’s work area.

   e. Review code before committing to the mainline.

   f. Make commits reversible
   
   g. A commit is not a backup of your current state of your local files, even if it occurs at the end of the day.
